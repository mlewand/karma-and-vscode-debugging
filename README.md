# karma-and-vscode-debugging

This is a repository with files used in my Karma and VSCode debugger integration tutorial.

You can find the tutorial on my blog's [Debugging Karma tests with VSCode](http://blog.mlewandowski.com/Debugging-Karma-tests-with-VSCode.html).

You can also find a fancy, moving version as an [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/lgMuiFKq9M4).
